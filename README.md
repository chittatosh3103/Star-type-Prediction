# Star-type-Prediction
Stars follow a certain graph in Celestial Space, called the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram or simply HR-Diagram. The Data set used obeys to a certain extent this graph. Hence, we can train a machine learning model to predict star type based on the following inputs:

Absolute Temperature (in K)
Relative Luminosity (L/Lo)
Relative Radius (R/Ro)
Absolute Magnitude (Mv)
Star Color
Spectral Class
where;
Lo = 3.828 x 10^26 Watts (Avg Luminosity of Sun)
Ro = 6.9551 x 10^8 m (Avg Radius of Sun)
